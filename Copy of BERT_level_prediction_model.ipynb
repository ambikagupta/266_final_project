Worrying about them over and over does nothing to help you. *Depression thrives in rumination*. Try looking into mindfulness meditation.

The truth is that I never dealt with it constructively, or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling. Part of the reason I think you and I are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively. In my case, I used constant denial and self-numbing ... At some point, I just assumed the pit was a part of me I could choose to ignore. You seem to be actively trying to experience it. You are engaging your sadness, which is objectively good for working through depression. It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :) If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort. Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard. In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality). Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'. But don't cover that feeling up.

Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed. Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people.

So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap.

Make a list of such jobs that you can opt for as per your top three skill-sets. 3. The next thing is to look for free or paid online resources to learn about that job and start applying. I would suggest starting with some easy job that you can find without any trouble. For instance, you can do data entry in the beginning.

It's like my brain is expanding but has no room. It's incredibly distracting.. I've tried taking everything from excedrin to ibuprofen and neither do anything. I also find it incredibly difficult to concentrate and remember anymore, constantly needed things repeated over and over slowly. Aside from the insomnia, I feel like the head pressure, concentration and memory issues are the most crippling part of depression for me, more so than the feeling of anhedonia and emptiness. Has anyone else experienced this? Has anything worked for you? Does it even get better? I feel like there's no end in sight.\n","For the past 6 months, I have had this persistent head pressure (not a migraine or headache). It's like my brain is expanding but has no room. It's incredibly distracting.. I've tried taking everything from excedrin to ibuprofen and neither do anything. I also find it incredibly difficult to concentrate and remember anymore, constantly needed things repeated over and over slowly.

Has anyone else experienced this? Has anything worked for you? Does it even get better? I feel like there's no end in sight.\n","I love you.. I may not know you personally but I want to say I love you. I almost committed suicide this last year. If you do decide to commit Suicide I won't be mad I don't know what your going through. I know sometimes the thought of nothingness sounds like a purgatory you'd want to live because that's better than the current hell your living. I was taken to the hospital and I've been through inpatient and out patient care. Zoloft and out patient care have been working for me so far. It's ok to be content to be slightly forlorn. If anyone needs me feel free to message me. If you suspect you have depression or have Suicidal thoughts or actions. Talk to your doctor. My therapist tells me to make plans to hold myself accountable to go out. I won't tell you you need a god or give you advice. I'm content with loving you and grieving with you if you need that. Depression is strange and terrible because you don't always know why your grieving. That's ok. Most of all I want to tell you I love you.\n","I love you..
